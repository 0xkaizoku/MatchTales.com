Welcome, AI Coding Agent! This file outlines the architecture, tech stack, rules, and guidelines for **MatchTales** to help you understand the codebase and make consistent, high-quality contributions.

## 1. Project Overview

**MatchTales** is a story-centric web platform. It began as the narrative layer on the **2026 FIFA World Cup** and now covers soccer, tennis, golf, American football, basketball and Formula 1 with the same question: why does this one matter?
*   **"Why Care" Scores & Reasons:** Editorial assessments of match, round and race stakes.
*   **Narrative Stories:** Previews and write-ups locked to named sources. No invented scorers.
*   **World Cup Archive:** 48 teams, 12 groups, completed 19 July 2026. Spain are champions.
*   **Sport desks:** mosaic at `/sports`. Unique boards at `/sport/tennis`, `/sport/football`, `/sport/f1`, `/sport/soccer`, `/sport/golf`, `/sport/basketball`. Soccer is one desk, not the default.
*   **Interactive Features:** Community hype walls, live second-screen companionship, newsletter subscriptions.
*   **Site clock:** editorial today is `2026-10-25` in `frontend/src/data/sports.ts` (`SITE_TODAY`). Tennis: Daniil Medvedev defended his Almaty Open title on Sunday, defeating Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-7(6), 6-1, 6-3 for his 25th career ATP singles title. Soccer: Premier League Matchweek 8 Saturday shocks: Tottenham stunned Chelsea 2-0 at Stamford Bridge (Tel 87', Penders 77' OG; Palmer red card); Aston Villa ended Man City's perfect run 2-1 (Jackson 6', 60'); Arsenal beat Everton 2-0 to join City atop the table on 21 points (7-0-1). Basketball: WNBA Finals Game 4: Golden State Valkyries fought off elimination and stunned Atlanta Dream 67-62 to tie the series 2-2; Game 5 shifts to Chase Center in San Francisco. F1: United States GP Sunday race day at COTA (15:00 local): Kimi Antonelli secured pole position (1:34.035) ahead of Max Verstappen (+0.179s) and leads George Russell by 102 points (340 to 238). Golf: Butterfield Bermuda Championship: Seamus Power and Austin Smotherman share the 54-hole lead at Port Royal; Chandler Blanchet and Kensei Hirata chase in Sunday final round. Football: NFL Week 7 Sunday: Unbeaten Chiefs (5-0, SNF at Seahawks), 49ers (6-0 at Falcons), and Vikings (5-0 vs Colts) put perfect records on the line following Chicago's 30-24 TNF win over New England.

## 2. Architecture & Tech Stack

The project is split into two main directories:

### Frontend (`/frontend`)
*   **Framework:** Astro 6.x (Static-first build with islands where interactive components are needed).
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Vanilla CSS & Tailwind config).
*   **Data Layer:** Seed data loaded from `src/data/seed.json`.
*   **Astro Content Collections:**
    *   `matches` (`src/content/matches/*.json`): Event JSON (World Cup plus other sports). Optional `sport`, `competition`, `format`, `sources`, `leaderboard`, `tennisSets`.
    *   `teams` (`src/content/teams/*.json`): Dossiers for the 48 World Cup countries.
    *   `stories` (`src/content/stories/*.md`): Markdown blogs. Optional `sport`, `sources`, `relatedSlug`. No em-dashes. No invented stats.
*   **Flag Rendering Utility:** `getFlagUrl(code)` in [site.ts](file:///frontend/src/lib/site.ts) maps FIFA country codes to FlagCDN images (e.g., `gb-eng` for England, `gb-sct` for Scotland). Do **NOT** use raw system emojis for flags, as they fail to render on many platforms (e.g., Windows).

### Backend (`/backend`)
*   **Framework:** FastAPI (Python 3.10+).
*   **Database:** MongoDB (persists newsletter signups, hype notes, and votes).
*   **Data Scripts:** 
    *   `backend/scripts/build_seed.py`: Builds the core database of 48 teams, 12 groups, and 72 matches.
    *   `backend/scripts/generate_real_world_content.py`: Content compiler that builds the JSON dossiers, match metadata, and long-form markdown stories.

## 4. Coding Standards & Guidelines

When modifying or expanding the codebase, you **must** adhere to the following rules:

### ⚠️ Content Rules
*   **No Em-dashes (`—`) or Double-hyphens (`--`):** In any generated match story or markdown file, avoid em-dashes or double-hyphens to comply with strict style linting rules. Use a standard dash (`-`) or colons instead.
*   **World Cup Accuracy:** Group allocations and qualified teams must strictly mirror the official 2026 FIFA World Cup draw (completed on December 5, 2025). This comprises 48 teams across 12 groups (A through L).

### 🎨 Visual & Styling Standards
*   **Use Rich Aesthetics:** Apply premium color palettes, smooth hover effects, micro-animations, and harmonized dark modes.
*   **No Default Emojis for Flags:** Always render flags using the `getFlagUrl` utility imported from `src/lib/site.ts`:
    ```astro
    import { getFlagUrl } from '../lib/site';
    <img src={getFlagUrl(team.code)} alt={team.name} class="w-6 h-4" loading="lazy" />
    ```
*   **Responsive Layouts:** Ensure all page headers, grid systems, and list views render correctly on both desktop viewports and mobile screens.

### ⚙️ Development Workflows
1.  **Regenerating Content:**
    If you modify team data or fixture algorithms, run the Python build pipeline:
    ```bash
    python backend/scripts/generate_real_world_content.py
    ```
2.  **Building the Frontend:**
    Always verify that the static Astro pages build correctly:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run build
    ```
3.  **Local Dev Server:**
    To run the Astro dev environment locally:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
