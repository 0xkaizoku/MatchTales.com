Welcome, AI Coding Agent! This file outlines the architecture, tech stack, rules, and guidelines for **MatchTales** to help you understand the codebase and make consistent, high-quality contributions.

## 1. Project Overview

**MatchTales** is a story-centric web platform. It began as the narrative layer on the **2026 FIFA World Cup** and now covers soccer, tennis, golf, American football, basketball and Formula 1 with the same question: why does this one matter?
*   **"Why Care" Scores & Reasons:** Editorial assessments of match, round and race stakes.
*   **Narrative Stories:** Previews and write-ups locked to named sources. No invented scorers.
*   **World Cup Archive:** 48 teams, 12 groups, completed 19 July 2026. Spain are champions.
*   **Sport desks:** mosaic at `/sports`. Unique boards at `/sport/tennis`, `/sport/football`, `/sport/f1`, `/sport/soccer`, `/sport/golf`, `/sport/basketball`. Soccer is one desk, not the default.
*   **Site clock:** editorial today is `2026-11-07` in `frontend/src/data/sports.ts` (`SITE_TODAY`). Football: Saturday 7 Nov has no NFL game. Sunday Madrid preview: Cincinnati Bengals at Atlanta Falcons, 9:30 a.m. ET at Santiago Bernabeu, NFL Network, CIN 5-2, ATL 3-5, unpublished as a score. Last NFL final remains Thursday 5 Nov: Jaguars 33, Ravens 10. Steelers 6-2 on a Week 9 bye. Basketball: Luka Doncic scores 53 as Los Angeles Lakers beat Portland Trail Blazers 124-118 on 6 Nov; Lakers on a four-game streak. Spurs 7-2. Cavaliers are 5-4. 76ers 8-2. Soccer: Noah Okafor 79th-minute winner as Leeds beat Tottenham 1-0 on 7 Nov. Friday: Everton 3-1 Coventry. Conservative PL after those two MW10 finals: Arsenal 24 from 9, City 21, Brighton 19, Chelsea 16, Everton 16 from 10, Leeds 14 from 10. Arsenal vs Hull unpublished. Tennis: Ben Shelton beats Luca Van Assche 5-7, 6-3, 6-4 in the Rolex Paris Masters semi-finals on 7 Nov; first American finalist since Sock 2017. Alcaraz vs Ruud unpublished. Formula 1: Max Verstappen leads Sao Paulo GP FP3 in 1:11.622 from Antonelli (+0.025s) and Norris. No Sprint. Qualifying unpublished. After Mexico, Antonelli is champion on 380; Mercedes 630, Ferrari 504. Golf: Ben James 65-64=129 leads WWT Championship after round 2 at El Cardonal; Malnati 130, Blair 132. Kirk 63-72=135. Cut 139. Round 3 unpublished as final.

## 2. Architecture & Tech Stack

The project is split into two main directories:

### Frontend (`/frontend`)
*   **Framework:** Astro 6.x (Static-first build with islands where interactive components are needed).
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Vanilla CSS & Tailwind config).
*   **Data Layer:** Seed data loaded from `src/data/seed.json`.
*   **Astro Content Collections:**
    *   `matches` (`src/content/matches/*.json`): Event JSON (World Cup plus other sports). Optional `sport`, `competition`, `format`, `sources`, `leaderboard`, `tennisSets`.
    *   `teams` (`src/content/teams/*.json`): Dossiers for the 48 World Cup countries.
    *   `stories` (`src/content/stories/*.md`): Markdown blogs. Optional `sport`, `sources`, `relatedSlug`. No em-dashes. No invented stats.
*   **Flag Rendering Utility:** `getFlagUrl(code)` in [site.ts](file:///frontend/src/lib/site.ts) maps FIFA country codes to FlagCDN images (e.g., `gb-eng` for England, `gb-sct` for Scotland). Do **NOT** use raw system emojis for flags, as they fail to render on many platforms (e.g., Windows).

### Backend (`/backend`)
*   **Framework:** FastAPI (Python 3.10+).
*   **Database:** MongoDB (persists newsletter signups, hype notes, and votes).
*   **Data Scripts:** 
    *   `backend/scripts/build_seed.py`: Builds the core database of 48 teams, 12 groups, and 72 matches.
    *   `backend/scripts/generate_real_world_content.py`: Content compiler that builds the JSON dossiers, match metadata, and long-form markdown stories.

## 4. Coding Standards & Guidelines

When modifying or expanding the codebase, you **must** adhere to the following rules:

### ⚠️ Content Rules
*   **No Em-dashes (`—`) or Double-hyphens (`--`):** In any generated match story or markdown file, avoid em-dashes or double-hyphens to comply with strict style linting rules. Use a standard dash (`-`) or colons instead.
*   **World Cup Accuracy:** Group allocations and qualified teams must strictly mirror the official 2026 FIFA World Cup draw (completed on December 5, 2025). This comprises 48 teams across 12 groups (A through L).

### 🎨 Visual & Styling Standards
*   **Use Rich Aesthetics:** Apply premium color palettes, smooth hover effects, micro-animations, and harmonized dark modes.
*   **No Default Emojis for Flags:** Always render flags using the `getFlagUrl` utility imported from `src/lib/site.ts`:
    ```astro
    import { getFlagUrl } from '../lib/site';
    <img src={getFlagUrl(team.code)} alt={team.name} class="w-6 h-4" loading="lazy" />
    ```
*   **Responsive Layouts:** Ensure all page headers, grid systems, and list views render correctly on both desktop viewports and mobile screens.

### ⚙️ Development Workflows
1.  **Regenerating Content:**
    If you modify team data or fixture algorithms, run the Python build pipeline:
    ```bash
    python backend/scripts/generate_real_world_content.py
    ```
2.  **Building the Frontend:**
    Always verify that the static Astro pages build correctly:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run build
    ```
3.  **Local Dev Server:**
    To run the Astro dev environment locally:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
